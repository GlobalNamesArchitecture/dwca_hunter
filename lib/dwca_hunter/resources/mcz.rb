        abstract: "The Museum of Comparative Zoology was founded in 1859 on " \
        "the concept that collections are an integral and fundamental " \
        "component of zoological research and teaching. This more than " \
        "150-year-old commitment remains a strong and proud tradition for " \
        "the MCZ. The present-day MCZ contains over 21-million specimens in " \
        "ten research collections which comprise one of the world's richest " \
        "and most varied resources for studying the diversity of life. The " \
        "museum serves as the primary repository for zoological specimens " \
        "collected by past and present Harvard faculty-curators, staff and " \
        "associates conducting research around the world. As a premier " \
        "university museum and research institution, the specimens and " \
        "their related data are available to researchers of the scientific " \
        "and museum community. doi:10.5281/zenodo.891420",
